# Ricks random Password Generator

## Description

This is a random password generator that i made with some basic starter code. 
It will promt the user to select the length of the password, and what criteria they would like to be met within their password. 
The use for this program is to generate a strong random password that uses criteria such as capital letters, numbers, and symbols.
I added variables, if then statements, defined functions, and outputed it to the HTML so that it was
fully functional on our webpage. I learned alot about how JS works and how loops and functions operate on the backend of this application.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password

WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
