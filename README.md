# Ricks random Password Generator

## Description

This is a random password generator that i made with some basic starter code. 
It will promt the user to select the length of the password, and what criteria they would like to be met within their password. 
The use for this program is to generate a strong random password that uses criteria such as capital letters, numbers, and symbols.
I added variables, if then statements, defined functions, and outputed it to the HTML so that it was
fully functional on our webpage. I learned alot about how JS works and how loops and functions operate on the backend of this application.
